# NLP_research_paper

Based on "Transfer fine-tuning: a BERT case study" you will write a reading report of 3 to 4 pages, which will contain: - An highlight and explanation of the main contribution(s) of the paper; - An analysis of the advantages and issues of the proposed method; - Your personal take on the interest, the contribution, and the relevance of the paper and how it could be improved on; - Your understanding of the related works, and possibly, of what followed: did the paper have an impact; was it improved on later by the authors, or others ? - And if the paper makes it possible, you can implement a part of the method/experiments to help you improve your understanding - or, if the code has been made available, you can use it directly as well. In this case, you can submit a python notebook (commented) with your report.
